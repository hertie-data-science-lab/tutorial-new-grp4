# Deep Learning E1394 - Tutorial

## Submitting your work

Once the deadline has passed, you are not able to push to your repository anymore or update it in any other way and all changes on the main branch will be considered for grading. In other words, there is no "submit" button which you need to press. You just need to ensure that all your work has been pushed / uploaded to GitHub before the deadline.

Uploading a new or edited file to GitHub involves three steps:
1. Add the file to the staging area:
    ```
    git add <file to be added>
    ```
2. Create a commit:
    ```
    git commit -m <commit msg - briefly describe your change>
    ```
3. Push the local commit to GitHub:
    ```
    git push
    ```

To avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same file, we recommend to push your changes as frequently as possible and always pull the latest changes from GitHub before you start working. Also, as a nice teammate, test your changes before you push them and use meaninful commit messages to make it easy to understand your changes.
