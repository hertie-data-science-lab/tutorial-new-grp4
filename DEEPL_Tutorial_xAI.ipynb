        "    *  Keep it short and simple. Avoid unnecessary complexity.\n",

        "\n",
        "<center><img src=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=large&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007007.g001\" width=400>\n",
        "\n",
        "<small>Rule, Adam, et al. \"Ten simple rules for writing and sharing computational analyses in Jupyter Notebooks.\" PLoS computational biology 15.7 (2019).</small></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 1: Tell a story for an audience\n",
        "* Interleave explanatory text and code to tell a compelling story.\n",
        "* Describe not just what you did but why you did it.\n",
        "* How you tell your story depends on your goal and your audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 2: Document the process, not just the results\n",
        "* Document relevant interactive explorations.\n",
        "* Don't wait until the end to add explanatory text.\n",
        "* Generate publication-ready version of figures from the get-go.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 3: Use cell divisions to make steps clear\n",
        "* Each cell should perform one meaningful step in the analysis.\n",
        "* Think one cell = one paragraph, function, or task (e.g. creating a plot).\n",
        "* Avoid long cells (50+ lines)\n",
        "* Organize your notebook into sections/subsections.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 4: Modularize code\n",
        "* Avoid duplicate code (no copy-pasting!)\n",
        "* Wrap the code that you want to reuse in a function.\n",
        "* Use descriptive and meaningful variable and function names.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 5: Record dependencies\n",
        "* Manage your dependencies using a package or environment manager (e.g. pip,conda)\n",
        "* Feel free to use tools like Binder or Docker to generate a \"container\" for better reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 6: Use version control\n",
        "- Google colab allows you to view revision history.\n",
        "- You can also opt to use Git and Github for version control.\n",
        "- As Jupyter uses JSON for serialization, tracking raw changes on GitHub is difficult. [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/) and [nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) can help to generate human-readable diffs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 7: Build a pipeline\n",
        "* A well-designed notebook can be generalized into a pipeline.\n",
        "* Place key variable declarations at the top/beginning of the notebook.\n",
        "* Make a habit of regularly restarting your kernel and rerunning all cells.\n",
        "* Before submitting, reinstall all dependencies and rerun all cells in a new enviroment to ensure reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 8: Share and explain your data\n",
        "* Properly reference the data you use.\n",
        "* If using your own data, make your data or a sample of your data publicly available along with the notebook.\n",
        "* You can opt to host public copies of your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule 9: Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored\n",
        "* Read: For code hosted in a public repository, add README and LICENSE files.\n",
        "* Run: Consider using Google Colab, Binder, or Docker for seamless replication.\n",
        "* Explore: Consider how you can design your notebook so future users can built on top of your work.\n",
